# mathematica-dynamics
A few physics simulations written in Mathematica notebooks: an arbitrary n-spring system, a double pendulum, and a more complex project comparing relativistic and nonrelativistic charged particle dynamics in electromagnetic fields.
## N-spring system
The Mathematica notebook file [springdynamics.nb](springdynamics.nb) provides code that generates the set of coupled differential equations governing a series of coupled springs (springs connected in a chain), then integrates these equations to obtain the motion of each spring and animates the result:
